# Stripe Customer Portal Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Summary
The customer portal was showing "Simple Apps, LLC" instead of "First Serve Seattle" even though:
- Payments were processing in the NEW (First Serve Seattle) Stripe account
- `USE_NEW_STRIPE_ACCOUNT=TRUE` was set correctly
- The portal configuration in Stripe was correct

## Root Cause
The database had an OLD subscription ID (`sub_1Rv2sNKSaqiJUYkjmWFBt2Yp`) from the cancelled Simple Apps account, while the ACTIVE subscription (`sub_1Rv96cQRPaPngbWPEGCdtSyf`) was in the NEW First Serve Seattle account.

When the portal tried to open:
1. It looked up the subscription ID from the database
2. Found it in the OLD account
3. Opened the OLD account's portal (showing "Simple Apps, LLC")

## Manual Fix (Completed)
We manually updated the database with the correct subscription information:

```sql
-- Check current subscription data
SELECT 
    email,
    stripe_customer_id,
    stripe_subscription_id,
    status,
    plan,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM subscribers
WHERE email = 'ryanrheger@gmail.com';

-- Update with correct NEW account IDs
UPDATE subscribers
SET 
    stripe_subscription_id = 'sub_1Rv96cQRPaPngbWPEGCdtSyf',
    stripe_customer_id = 'cus_SqqoMqklnPnSyU',
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'ryanrheger@gmail.com';
```

This immediately fixed the portal to show "First Serve Seattle" and allow subscription management.

## Automated Fix (To Test)

### What We Changed

1. **Portal Route (`/api/create-portal-link/route.ts`)**:
   - Now checks NEW account FIRST when `USE_NEW_STRIPE_ACCOUNT=true`
   - Added extensive logging to track which account is being used
   - Verifies if customer exists in both accounts

2. **Webhook Handler (`/api/stripe-webhook-new/route.ts`)**:
   - Fixed issue where undefined values weren't updating in database
   - Removed strict price ID validation that was rejecting valid subscriptions
   - Added comprehensive logging for all subscription events

### Testing the Automated Fix

#### Test 1: Webhook Update Test
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard (First Serve Seattle account)
2. Navigate to Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Find the webhook for `https://firstserveseattle.com/api/stripe-webhook-new`
4. Click on a recent `customer.subscription.updated` event
5. Click "Resend"
6. Check Vercel logs for:
   ```
   üîÑ [NEW WEBHOOK] Subscription updated
   üìù [NEW WEBHOOK] Upserting subscriber
   ‚úÖ [NEW WEBHOOK] Subscriber updated successfully
   ```
7. Verify database has correct subscription ID

#### Test 2: New Subscription Test
1. Create a test subscription with a new email
2. Check Vercel logs for:
   ```
   üÜï [NEW WEBHOOK] Checkout completed - Creating subscription
   ‚úÖ [NEW WEBHOOK] Subscription created in database
   ```
3. Verify portal works immediately without manual intervention

#### Test 3: Portal Access Test
1. Click "Manage Subscription" button
2. Check Vercel logs for:
   ```
   üéØ PORTAL: USE_NEW_STRIPE_ACCOUNT is TRUE, checking NEW account FIRST
   ‚úÖ PORTAL: Found subscription in NEW account!
   ‚úÖ PORTAL: Portal session created successfully!
   ```
3. Verify portal shows "First Serve Seattle" branding

### Expected Log Output

When working correctly, you should see:

```
üîç Portal Debug: {
  USE_NEW_STRIPE_ACCOUNT: 'TRUE',
  useNewAccount: true,
  hasNewStripe: true,
  subscriptionId: 'sub_1Rv96cQRPaPngbWPEGCdtSyf',
  userEmail: 'ryanrheger@gmail.com'
}
üéØ PORTAL: USE_NEW_STRIPE_ACCOUNT is TRUE, checking NEW account FIRST
üîç PORTAL: Attempting to retrieve subscription from NEW Stripe account
‚úÖ PORTAL: Found subscription in NEW account!
‚úÖ PORTAL: Customer ID: cus_SqqoMqklnPnSyU
‚úÖ PORTAL: Will use NEW Stripe instance for portal creation
üöÄ PORTAL: Creating portal session...
üöÄ PORTAL: Using Stripe instance: ‚úÖ NEW ACCOUNT (First Serve Seattle)
‚úÖ PORTAL: Portal session created successfully!
‚úÖ PORTAL: Account used: NEW (First Serve Seattle)
```

### Environment Variables to Verify

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
USE_NEW_STRIPE_ACCOUNT=TRUE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_NEW=[your new account secret key]
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_NEW=[your new account publishable key]
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_NEW=[your new webhook secret]
STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID_NEW=[your actual monthly price ID]
STRIPE_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID_NEW=[your actual annual price ID]
```

**Important**: Your monthly price ID is `price_1Rv1uTQRPaPngbWPBsQL66v0` - make sure to set `STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID_NEW` to this value.

### Troubleshooting

If the automated fix doesn't work:

1. **Check webhook endpoint URL**: Must be `/api/stripe-webhook-new` (not `/api/stripe-webhook`)
2. **Check webhook events**: Must include `customer.subscription.created` and `customer.subscription.updated`
3. **Check Vercel logs**: Look for any error messages in the webhook processing
4. **Verify environment variables**: Especially the price IDs

### Success Criteria

‚úÖ New subscriptions automatically use NEW account IDs in database
‚úÖ Portal shows "First Serve Seattle" for all users
‚úÖ Cancel subscription option is available
‚úÖ No manual SQL updates required
