The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility consists of two concrete hard courts dedicated to tennis. The courts are situated within a larger park that also includes a basketball court and a unique play area. There are no lights, so all play is limited to daylight hours, which is common for parks prioritizing natural scenery and minimizing light pollution.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The atmosphere at Magnolia Park is serene and awe-inspiring. The panoramic views of Puget Sound create a peaceful and often distracting backdrop for a tennis match. The park is a popular spot for picnicking and sightseeing, but the tennis courts themselves are often less crowded than those at the more centrally located Magnolia Playfield. This makes it a great option for players looking for a relaxed game in a beautiful setting.

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Magnolia Park

The view is both a blessing and a curse. The stunning scenery can easily break a player's concentration. The player who can best tune out the distracting beauty and focus on the ball will have a significant mental edge. More practically, the court's exposed location on the bluff means wind coming off the Puget Sound is almost always a factor. Players must be adept at adjusting their serves and groundstrokes to the conditions. A strong slice serve that stays low can be particularly effective here.

Location, Access, and Amenities

Magnolia Park is located along the scenic Magnolia Boulevard. Ample parking is available in a paved lot, which is a major convenience. The park is well-equipped with amenities, including public restrooms, numerous picnic tables and benches strategically placed to maximize the views, and a children's playground.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Magnolia

Magnolia is a large, affluent residential neighborhood known for its quiet streets, beautiful homes, and the massive Discovery Park at its northern tip. While Magnolia Park is somewhat removed from the main commercial hub (the "Magnolia Village"), it is a destination in itself. After a match, players can enjoy a picnic in the park, take a scenic drive along the boulevard, or head into the village for a coffee or meal.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Magnolia Park is universally praised for its spectacular views and peaceful atmosphere. Visitors love the ample open space, picnic areas, and well-maintained facilities. For tennis players, the combination of good courts and world-class scenery is a major draw. The main limitations are the lack of lights and the constant presence of wind, which can make for challenging playing conditions.
