## Observatory Tennis

*Your First Serve of Information*

Officially named Observatory Courts, this two-court facility in Upper Queen Anne offers a solid neighborhood tennis experience with the added bonus of being a local secret for avoiding crowds. Tucked away in a residential area, these courts provide a simple, no-frills option for players looking for a quiet, casual game.

### The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility features two concrete hard courts that are shared with pickleball players. Tennis players should expect dual lines on the court surface. The courts are unlit, restricting all play to daylight hours. There are no other significant amenities like backboards or restrooms directly at the courts.   

### The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The primary draw of Observatory Courts is their availability. They are often uncrowded, even on weekends, making them a reliable choice for drop-in play when other, more popular courts are full. The atmosphere is quiet and residential, perfect for a low-key practice session or a relaxed match. The vibe is very much that of a hidden neighborhood spot.   

### Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Observatory

The courts are in a relatively exposed location on top of Queen Anne hill, which can make for windy conditions. Players who can control the ball in the wind will have a distinct advantage. Additionally, the west-facing orientation can lead to significant sun glare during the late afternoon and sunset, which can be a powerful tactical weapon if you position your opponent to face the sun. Come prepared with a good hat and sunglasses.   

### Location, Access, and Amenities

The courts are located on Warren Ave N in a residential part of Queen Anne. Street parking is the only option. This is a very basic facility with no on-site amenities such as restrooms or drinking fountains. Players should bring everything they need with them. The famous Kerry Park, with its iconic views of the Seattle skyline, is just a short walk or drive away.   

### The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Queen Anne

Queen Anne is one of Seattle's most desirable neighborhoods, known for its beautiful historic homes, stunning views, and charming commercial district on Queen Anne Ave N. After a match, players can easily head to "The Ave" to enjoy a wide variety of excellent cafes, bakeries, restaurants, and shops. The cultural attractions of the Seattle Center are also just down the hill in Lower Queen Anne.   

### From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Observatory Courts are praised by those in the know for one key feature: they are often available when other courts are packed. It's a go-to spot for players looking to avoid a wait. The potential for windy conditions and sunset glare are the main drawbacks from a playing perspective. The lack of amenities is a trade-off for the peace and availability the courts provide.
