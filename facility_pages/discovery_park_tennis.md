The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility consists of two concrete tennis courts located near the southeast corner of the park. The courts are dual-lined, with permanent markings for four pickleball courts, so tennis players should be prepared for the extra lines on the surface. Pickleball players are required to bring their own nets. The courts are unlit, preserving the park's natural ambiance and limiting play to daylight hours.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The defining characteristic of playing at Discovery Park is the unparalleled peace and quiet. The courts are set away from the main roads and offer a serene, focused environment. Due to the park's vast size and the courts' somewhat remote location within it, they are often less crowded than other city courts. This makes Discovery Park an excellent choice for players looking to practice or have a casual game without the pressure of long wait times. The atmosphere is relaxed and respectful of the natural surroundings.

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Discovery Park

The primary strategic element at Discovery Park is mental. Use the tranquil environment to your advantage. This is a place to clear your head and focus entirely on your game, free from urban distractions. However, the courts are exposed, so be mindful of changing weather coming off of Puget Sound. Wind can be a factor, so adjust your service toss and shot selection accordingly. The biggest challenge isn't on the court, but getting to it; the walk from the parking lot can serve as a good warm-up, so arrive with enough time to get to the courts without rushing.

Location, Access, and Amenities

The tennis courts are located within the massive Discovery Park. There is no parking directly adjacent to the courts; the nearest lot is the east parking lot by the Discovery Park Visitor Center, which is a walk of a few hundred yards. Restrooms are available at the Visitor Center. The park's main amenities are its incredible network of trails, protected tidal beaches, open meadows, and stunning views of Puget Sound and the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Magnolia

The courts are in the Magnolia neighborhood, a peaceful, scenic residential area known for its beautiful homes and strong community feel. The "Magnolia Village" on W McGraw Street offers a charming collection of local shops, bakeries, and restaurants for a post-match meal. However, the main attraction after playing tennis is Discovery Park itself; players can easily spend hours exploring the trails, visiting the West Point Lighthouse, or relaxing on the beach.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Discovery Park is cherished as a natural oasis within the city. While tennis is not the park's main draw, the courts are valued by those who use them for their quiet and beautiful setting. The need to walk from the parking lot is a minor inconvenience for some but also contributes to the courts' low-key, uncrowded nature. The dual-lining for pickleball is a factor, but the lower traffic means conflicts over space are less common than at more central parks.
