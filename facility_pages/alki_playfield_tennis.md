## Alki Playfield Tennis

*Your First Serve of Information*

Nestled in the heart of West Seattle's vibrant Alki neighborhood, the Alki Playfield tennis courts offer a unique "beach town" tennis experience just a short walk from the iconic Alki Beach. These two courts are part of the larger Alki Playground complex, which includes a community center, sports fields, and a popular play area, making it a lively hub of community activity.

### The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The two courts at Alki Playfield are standard concrete hard courts. However, their condition and future use have been the subject of significant local debate, with some community members expressing frustration over their upkeep while others use them actively for both tennis and pickleball. Players should be prepared for a surface that may show signs of wear.   

This is a flashpoint location in the city's ongoing tennis vs. pickleball dialogue. The courts are dual-lined for pickleball and are extremely popular with that community, which sometimes brings its own nets. Tennis players should expect heavy pickleball use, especially during daytime hours and on weekends, and be prepared to share the space.   

### The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

Given the high demand from pickleball players, tennis players may find it challenging to secure a court during peak hours. The atmosphere is energetic and social but can be intense due to the shared-use dynamic. To avoid long waits, tennis players should consider visiting during off-peak hours, such as early mornings on weekdays. Adherence to public court etiquette—a 90-minute limit for doubles when others are waiting—is essential for ensuring fair rotation between all user groups.   

### Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Alki

The courts' proximity to Puget Sound means that wind is often a significant factor in play. Players should come prepared to adjust their game accordingly. A lower, more compact ball toss on serves can help maintain consistency. Utilizing spin is also key; heavy topspin can help control shots that might otherwise sail long in the wind, while a low, biting slice can be difficult for opponents to handle in breezy conditions. Additionally, note the court's east-west orientation. In the late afternoon, the player on the east side of the court will be looking directly into the setting sun over the Sound—a major tactical advantage that can be exploited with high, deep lobs.

### Location, Access, and Amenities

The courts are conveniently located adjacent to the Alki Community Center and Alki Elementary School. Restrooms are available right next to the courts. While street parking is available, it is notoriously competitive in the Alki area, especially on sunny days, during the summer, and at school drop-off/pickup times. The facility's location within a larger park that includes a playground, basketball courts, and sports fields makes it a great destination for players with families.   

### The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Alki

Alki is Seattle's quintessential beach town, famous for its long sandy beach, flat walking and biking path, and stunning views of the city skyline and the Olympic Mountains. After a match, players can take a short stroll to Alki Avenue SW to enjoy a wide variety of coffee shops, restaurants, and bars with waterfront views.   

### From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Players appreciate the scenic location and the convenience of on-site amenities like restrooms and a playground, which make the park a vibrant and active community space. The primary drawback noted in public forums is the intense competition for court time with the pickleball community. The court surface condition has also been a point of local debate and may not be pristine.
