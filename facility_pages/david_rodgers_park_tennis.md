The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The park features three concrete hard courts that are generally considered to be in good condition, with solid nets and no major cracks. A significant asset for solo players is the tennis practice hitting-board, perfect for warming up or drilling groundstrokes. The courts are dedicated to tennis, but recent community discussions have highlighted a desire from pickleball players for the courts to be resurfaced and dual-lined, indicating potential future changes. As of now, they remain a haven for tennis purists. There are no lights for evening play.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

David Rodgers Park is a popular spot that gets a lot of love from the local tennis community, including coaches and regular players. The atmosphere is focused and respectful, but also social and welcoming. With three courts, availability is better than at two-court facilities, but reservations are still recommended, especially on weekends and sunny afternoons, to avoid disappointment. The surrounding park, with its rolling hills and large grassy areas, creates a peaceful and scenic environment for a match.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at David Rodgers Park

The wooded, hilly setting of the park can create tricky playing conditions. The surrounding trees can cast moving shadows across the courts, especially in the morning and late afternoon, which can affect ball tracking. Players with sharp focus and quick reactions to changing light conditions will have an edge. The courts are somewhat sheltered, but wind can still be a factor. Use the practice backboard to its full potential; a solid 15-minute session before your match can get your timing and footwork dialed in, giving you a significant advantage from the first serve.

Location, Access, and Amenities

The park is located in Upper Queen Anne, with paths winding down to the Queen Anne Bowl playfields. There is no dedicated parking lot, but free street parking is usually easy to find on the surrounding residential streets. The facility is well-appointed with public restrooms, a children's play area renovated in 2019, picnic tables, and beautiful walking paths.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Queen Anne

Queen Anne is one of Seattle's most iconic neighborhoods, known for its historic homes, stunning views from Kerry Park, and the cultural hub of the Seattle Center at its base. The "Upper Queen Anne" area around the park has a charming, village-like commercial district along Queen Anne Ave N, offering a wonderful selection of cafes, bakeries, and boutique shops perfect for a post-match coffee or meal.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

This facility is highly regarded by local players for its well-groomed courts, the valuable inclusion of a practice backboard, and the beautiful, serene park setting. Its popularity means it can get busy, making reservations a smart choice. The main drawback is the lack of lights, which limits play to daylight hours. There is also growing pressure from the pickleball community to convert the courts to shared use, a point of concern for some tennis players.
