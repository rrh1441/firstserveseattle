## The West Seattle Hub: Walt Hundley Playfield

*Your First Serve of Information*

Walt Hundley Playfield is a bustling, 11-acre athletic complex in the High Point neighborhood of West Seattle, named in honor of a pivotal figure in the city's history. Walter R. Hundley was the first African-American superintendent of Seattle Parks and Recreation and a prominent leader in the Civil Rights movement; his dedication to creating green spaces for the community is embodied in this park. Playing tennis here is to be part of a vibrant, multi-sport environment that serves as a central hub for the diverse High Point community.

### The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The playfield features two tennis courts located in the northwest section of the park, just south of the High Point Community Center. The courts do not have lights, so play is limited to daylight hours. In response to the growing demand for pickleball, the courts have been lined to accommodate four pickleball courts, making this a shared-use facility. This dual-use status is a key feature of the playing experience here. According to the city's reservation system, one of the two courts is reservable online, while the other is designated for drop-in play.   

### The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The atmosphere at Walt Hundley Playfield is active and sports-focused. The park is a hub for organized sports, with a lighted turf soccer field and two baseball fields that are frequently in use by local leagues. The tennis and pickleball courts are similarly popular, drawing a consistent crowd of players. The vibe is energetic and competitive, particularly in the evenings and on weekends.   

The courts are a well-known hotspot for pickleball in West Seattle, with a strong and active community of players. Tennis players should expect to share the space and may find that pickleball is the dominant activity at certain times of the day.   

### Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Walt Hundley

The shared-use nature of the courts presents a unique social dynamic. Players who are flexible and communicative will have the best experience. The courts are straightforward, but the constant activity from the adjacent soccer and baseball fields can be a source of ambient noise, requiring good concentration. The park's location in High Point, one of the highest areas in Seattle, can also lead to breezy conditions.

### Location, Access, and Amenities

Walt Hundley Playfield is located in the heart of the High Point neighborhood, adjacent to the High Point Community Center. Street parking is available on the surrounding streets, such as 34th Ave SW.   

The 11-acre park is well-equipped with athletic facilities, including a lighted synthetic turf soccer field, two baseball fields, and a children's play area that was renovated in 2019. Restrooms and drinking fountains are also available on-site.   

Beyond the Baseline in High Point

High Point is a unique, master-planned community in West Seattle known for its mixed-income housing, diverse population, and focus on sustainable, "green" design. It is a dense, family-friendly neighborhood with a strong sense of community and numerous parks and open spaces. While primarily residential, it is a short drive from the commercial hubs of West Seattle, such as the Alaska and Morgan Junctions.   

### From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

The playfield is highly regarded as a vital community asset, praised for its excellent range of sports facilities and well-maintained grounds. The courts are particularly popular with the West Seattle pickleball community, with players noting that it is a destination for high-level, competitive play. There is a strong push from this community to designate the facility as a dedicated pickleball hub, reflecting the intense demand for the sport in the area. For tennis players, this means Walt Hundley Playfield is a reliable place to find a game, but one where they will be sharing the courts with a passionate and organized group of pickleball enthusiasts.
