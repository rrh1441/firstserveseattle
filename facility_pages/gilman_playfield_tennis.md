The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility features two concrete hard courts located in the southwest corner of the park, next to the restrooms. The courts and nets are reported to be in reasonably good condition. However, there are no lights for evening play and no practice backboard. These courts have become a major hotspot for pickleball, and tennis players should expect to share the space. The high demand from pickleball players means the courts are often full, with organized paddle-stacking systems in place to manage rotation.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

Gilman Playfield is very popular and often crowded, especially on nice days. The atmosphere is social and friendly, but the high demand creates a competitive environment for court time. Tennis players may find it challenging to secure a court, as pickleball players often occupy both. One court is typically reservable through the city system, while the other is for drop-in play. For tennis players wanting to play a match, reserving the court in advance is the most reliable strategy to avoid being crowded out by the pickleball open play.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Gilman

The biggest strategic challenge at Gilman is simply getting on the court to play tennis. The best tactic is to use the Seattle Parks reservation system to book one of the courts ahead of time. This guarantees your spot and bypasses the crowded drop-in scene. If you do play drop-in, be prepared for a potentially long wait and the background noise of multiple pickleball games. Once on the court, the play is straightforward. The surrounding park is relatively open, so wind could be a minor factor on breezy days.

Location, Access, and Amenities

The park is located in a high-density neighborhood, and finding street parking can be difficult, often requiring a walk of a few blocks. The park offers restrooms, although they are typically closed during the winter months. Other amenities include two baseball fields, a small playground, and a basketball court. The park is surrounded by ongoing construction, reflecting the rapid growth of the Ballard area.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Ballard

Ballard is a trendy and historic neighborhood with a unique blend of maritime heritage and modern foodie culture. After a match, players can explore the vibrant Ballard Avenue, with its boutique shops, acclaimed restaurants, and numerous breweries. The nearby Ballard Locks and Golden Gardens Park are also major attractions. The Gilman Playfield area itself has seen some issues with homeless encampments and safety concerns, though conditions can vary.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

The park is praised for being a well-maintained community space with good facilities for various sports. However, the overwhelming popularity of pickleball has made it a challenging location for tennis players. Public forums are filled with discussions from both tennis and pickleball players trying to navigate the shared use of the two courts. Parking is a consistent challenge, and the seasonal closure of the restrooms is an inconvenience.
