### The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility features four dedicated tennis courts, providing ample space for the local community. The courts are situated downhill from the community center and are surrounded by the playfield's grassy swards and ballfields. There are no lights at this facility, which, given the neighborhood's activism regarding park lighting in other contexts, is likely to remain the case. Play is therefore limited to daylight hours.   

### The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

Laurelhurst Playfield is a very popular and active park, especially with families and youth sports leagues. The atmosphere around the tennis courts is generally pleasant and community-oriented. With four courts, it's a significant neighborhood facility, and demand can be high, particularly after school and on sunny weekends. While drop-in play is common, making a reservation is a good idea to secure a court during peak times.   

### Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Laurelhurst

The courts are set in a relatively open playfield, which means wind can be a factor, especially on breezy days near Lake Washington. Players with a strong slice game that stays low in the wind can find an advantage. The park is often busy with youth sports and playground activity, so the ability to maintain focus amidst background noise is beneficial. The courts are well-maintained, rewarding players with clean, consistent strokes.

### Location, Access, and Amenities

The playfield is located in the heart of the Laurelhurst neighborhood. Parking is available in a small lot and on the street. The adjacent Laurelhurst Community Center houses the restrooms, which are typically open during park hours. The park also features a playground with a unique historical ferry theme, Little League baseball fields, and several water fountains. A notable feature is a historic fire pit dating to 1926, the only one of its kind in the Seattle park system.   

### The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Laurelhurst

Laurelhurst is one of Seattle's most exclusive residential neighborhoods, characterized by its beautiful, stately homes and tree-lined streets on a peninsula jutting into Lake Washington. The neighborhood has a strong community feel, centered around the playfield and the private Laurelhurst Beach Club. For post-match refreshments, the upscale University Village shopping center, with its wide array of restaurants and cafes, is just a short drive away.   

### From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

The facility is considered a high-quality neighborhood asset with a good number of courts. The park's extensive amenities, including the community center and well-equipped playground, make it a popular family destination. The primary limitation for tennis players is the lack of lights, which restricts play, especially outside of the summer months.
