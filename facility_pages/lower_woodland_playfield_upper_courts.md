## Lower Woodland Playfield Upper Courts

Your First Serve of Information

Distinct from the main 10-court complex, the Upper Courts at Woodland Park offer a more secluded and often quieter tennis experience. Located on the southern edge of the park off N 50th Street, these four courts provide a great alternative for players looking to escape the intensity of the main Lower Woodland hub while still enjoying the convenient Phinney Ridge location.

The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility consists of four concrete hard courts that are reported to be in reasonably good shape. These courts are dedicated to tennis and do not have pickleball lines. A key difference from the lower courts is the lack of lights, which means play is restricted to daylight hours.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The Upper Courts provide a much more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere compared to their downstream counterparts. Tucked away from the main hustle of the park, they are a favorite for lessons and more casual matches. While they can still get busy on sunny weekends, it is often easier to find an open court here than at the main complex. The vibe is less intensely competitive and more focused on recreational play.

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at the Upper Courts

The quieter setting of the Upper Courts is ideal for players working on new aspects of their game without the pressure of a large audience. Use this focused environment to drill serves or practice tricky shots. The courts are surrounded by trees, which can provide some shelter from the wind but may also cast moving shadows on the court during certain times of day. Being aware of the light conditions and adjusting your positioning can be a subtle advantage.

Location, Access, and Amenities

The courts are located on the south side of Woodland Park, near the Rose Garden and the Zoo's south entrance. The parking lot that was once nearby has been closed in recent years, so players must rely on street parking along N 50th Street and in the surrounding neighborhood, which can be competitive. There are no restrooms immediately adjacent to these courts; the nearest facilities are within the main park area.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Phinney Ridge/Wallingford

These courts straddle the border of the Phinney Ridge and Wallingford neighborhoods. Phinney Ridge, to the west, offers a charming commercial strip along Phinney Ave N with unique shops and restaurants. Wallingford, to the east, is a vibrant, family-friendly neighborhood with a bustling commercial district on N 45th Street. Both offer excellent post-match options. The Woodland Park Zoo and Rose Garden are also major attractions right next door.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

The Upper Courts are valued as a great, often less-crowded alternative to the main Lower Woodland facility. Players appreciate the good condition of the courts and the more peaceful setting. The primary drawbacks are the lack of lights, which limits playing time, and the somewhat challenging parking situation since the closure of the adjacent lot.
