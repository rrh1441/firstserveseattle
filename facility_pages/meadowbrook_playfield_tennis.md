## Meadowbrook Playfield Tennis

*Your First Serve of Information*

Located in the Meadowbrook neighborhood of Northeast Seattle, this playfield offers a single, lighted tennis court as part of a large, 20-acre recreational complex. Adjacent to the Meadowbrook Community Center and Pool, this facility is a hub of activity, but the single court provides a unique, focused tennis experience for local players.

### The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility consists of a single concrete hard court. A major advantage of this court is that it is equipped with lights, allowing for evening play. However, some player reviews have noted that the court is in fair to poor shape, so players should be prepared for a surface that may not be pristine. It is a dedicated tennis court.   

### The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

As a single court, availability is the biggest challenge at Meadowbrook. It is often used for lessons, and when it's not reserved, it's available on a first-come, first-served basis. Player reviews suggest that despite its condition, it "always has availability," which may indicate it is less sought-after than other courts in the area. The atmosphere is that of a bustling community park, with the adjacent pool, playground, and community center creating a lively environment.   

### Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Meadowbrook

The single-court setup offers a private, focused playing experience once you secure the court. With no adjacent matches to distract you, this is an excellent location for a serious practice session or a one-on-one lesson. The key is planning; check the reservation schedule online before you go to see if the court is booked. If it's open, you can enjoy a match without the typical distractions of a multi-court facility. Be prepared to adapt your game to a surface that may have some imperfections.   

### Location, Access, and Amenities

Meadowbrook Playfield is a comprehensive park with excellent amenities. A large parking lot serves the complex, and restrooms and drinking water are available. The park features a playground, picnic sites, baseball fields, a community center, and the Meadowbrook Pool. The park is also notable for its connection to the Thornton Creek watershed, with restoration projects and natural areas nearby.   

### The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Meadowbrook

Meadowbrook is a quiet residential neighborhood in the Lake City district of Northeast Seattle. It is characterized by its lush greenery and the central hub of the community center and adjacent schools (Nathan Hale High School and Jane Addams Middle School). While the neighborhood itself has few commercial businesses, it is conveniently located between the commercial corridors of Lake City Way NE and 35th Ave NE, offering easy access to a variety of shops and restaurants.   

### From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

The playfield is a beloved community asset, praised for its wide range of facilities and beautiful park setting. For tennis players, the court is a mixed bag. The presence of lights is a major plus, but its singular nature makes it hard to rely on for spontaneous play. Its reported "fair/poor" condition is a significant drawback for players seeking a high-quality surface.
