## The Evolving Playfield: Soundview Playfield

Your First Serve of Information

Soundview Playfield, located in Seattle's Crown Hill neighborhood, is a park in transition. Long a reliable 10.5-acre neighborhood hub for sports and family fun, it is currently undergoing a major renovation set to transform its central athletic fields into a modern, all-season facility. This forward-looking project reflects the city's commitment to upgrading its recreational infrastructure. For tennis players, this means the courts exist alongside a site of active improvement, promising an even more vibrant and capable community space upon completion in the fall of 2025.

The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility features two hard-surface tennis courts located in the northwest corner of the park, north of the playground. The courts are unlit and have recently been re-lined to accommodate shared use for both tennis and pickleball, with markings for four pickleball courts. This dual-use designation makes them a versatile space for the community's racquet sport enthusiasts. One of the two courts is available for online reservation, while the other remains open for drop-in play.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The atmosphere at Soundview is that of a classic, multi-use playfield. It is a popular spot for local families, with a playground featuring a mini zip line, a summer wading pool, and fields for baseball and soccer. The courts are actively used by both tennis and pickleball players, creating a dynamic and social environment.   

With only two courts and no lights, they are busiest during after-school and weekend hours. The ongoing renovation of the main playfield may temporarily alter access and atmosphere, but the courts are expected to remain a key feature of the park.

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Soundview

The courts at Soundview are straightforward, but their shared-use status requires flexibility. Players may need to wait or share the space with pickleball players. The park is adjacent to Whitman Middle School, and activity from the school can add to the ambient noise during the school year.   

Location, Access, and Amenities

Soundview Playfield is located in the Crown Hill neighborhood of northwest Seattle, adjacent to Whitman Middle School. Street parking is available around the park. The park offers a comprehensive set of amenities, including two baseball fields, a soccer field, a children's playground, and a wading pool for summer use.   

The most significant feature is the current "Soundview Playfield Athletic Field Renovation." This project, funded by the Seattle Park District, is converting the central natural grass field into a state-of-the-art synthetic turf field with modern, energy-efficient lighting. The renovation also includes improving accessibility with new ADA-compliant pathways, ensuring the park will be a more inclusive and year-round destination for multiple sports upon its completion.   

Beyond the Baseline in Crown Hill

Crown Hill is a quiet, family-friendly neighborhood with a relaxed, suburban feel. It is known for its tree-lined streets and mix of mid-century and modern homes. While primarily residential, it offers easy access to the more bustling commercial districts of neighboring Ballard and Greenwood. The neighborhood is well-served by green spaces, with Carkeek Park to the north and Golden Gardens Park a short drive away.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Soundview Playfield is a well-regarded neighborhood park, valued for its wide range of amenities that cater to families and sports enthusiasts. The tennis courts are considered to be in reasonably good shape, and their recent lining for pickleball reflects the city's effort to accommodate multiple user groups. The community is largely anticipating the completion of the major field renovation, which promises to elevate the park into a premier athletic facility for the entire northwest Seattle area.
