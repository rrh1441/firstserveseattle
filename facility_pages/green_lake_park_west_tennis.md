## Green Lake Park West Tennis

Your First Serve of Information

Located on the western edge of Seattle's iconic Green Lake Park, these two courts offer a classic park tennis experience in one of the city's most popular recreational areas. Surrounded by the lush scenery of the park and the constant buzz of activity on the nearby 3-mile loop, playing here means being part of the vibrant Green Lake community.

The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility consists of two concrete hard courts located off West Green Lake Drive North. The courts are reported to be in reasonably good shape. These courts are separate from the larger tennis complex at Lower Woodland Park (south of the lake) and the dedicated pickleball hub on the east side of the lake. This separation makes them a relatively quiet spot for dedicated tennis play. There are no lights, so play is limited to daylight hours.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

While Green Lake Park itself is extremely busy, these specific courts on the west side tend to be less crowded than the main tennis hub at Lower Woodland. The atmosphere is relaxed, with the scenic backdrop of the lake and park. Players should expect some background noise from the constant stream of joggers, bikers, and walkers on the main path. With only two courts, they can fill up on sunny days, but availability is generally better here than at the more prominent facilities in the area.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Green Lake West

The biggest environmental factor here is the potential for distraction. The courts are in close proximity to the highly trafficked Green Lake loop. Players who can maintain their focus amidst the constant flow of people and park activity will have an advantage. The courts are fairly open, so wind coming off the lake can influence play. Pay attention to the breeze direction when choosing which side to serve from and be prepared to adjust your shot depth and height accordingly.

Location, Access, and Amenities

Parking is available in lots and along the street around Green Lake Park, but it is extremely competitive and can be difficult to find, especially on weekends and sunny days. Public restrooms are available at several locations within the park, such as the Green Lake Community Center and near the play areas. The primary amenity is the park itself, which offers a wealth of recreational opportunities, including swimming, boating, and the famous walking/biking loop.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Green Lake

Green Lake is a vibrant, active neighborhood centered around the park. The area is packed with coffee shops, restaurants, and athletic stores catering to the active lifestyle of its residents. After a match, players can easily find a spot for a coffee, a meal, or a celebratory drink. The neighborhood is also known for its strong pickleball community, which is now centered on the east side of the lake.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Green Lake Park as a whole is one of Seattle's most beloved public spaces. The tennis courts are considered a valuable part of the park's offerings. While the courts at Lower Woodland are the main draw for serious tennis players (the "Greenlake mafia"), the west side courts provide a more casual and often more accessible alternative. The primary challenge, as with anything at Green Lake, is parking.
