The park serves as a vital green space and a crucial transportation corridor, connecting neighborhoods and people with its network of trails and its unique position atop a major freeway.

The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility features a double tennis court, with two courts sitting side-by-side. The courts are unlit, limiting play to daylight hours. They are located on the east side of Martin Luther King Jr. Way S, integrated into the park's layout of lawns, picnic areas, and walking paths. The courts are standard, functional concrete surfaces that serve the recreational needs of the surrounding community.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The atmosphere at Sam Smith Park is that of a busy, well-used urban park. It is a hub of activity, popular with dog owners heading to the Blue Dog Pond off-leash area, families at the playground, and cyclists and runners utilizing the I-90 trail system. The background sound is a constant, low hum of traffic from the freeway below, a reminder of the park's unique engineering.   

With only two courts, they can be occupied during peak after-work and weekend hours, but the park's diverse amenities mean that tennis is just one of many activities drawing people to the area.

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Sam Smith Park

The primary strategic element is adapting to the urban environment. The courts are functional and straightforward, but the constant flow of people and the ambient noise from I-90 require a solid level of focus. The park's location on the I-90 lid makes it relatively open and exposed, so players should be prepared for variable wind conditions.

Location, Access, and Amenities

Sam Smith Park is centrally located, spanning the I-90 freeway and bordered by Martin Luther King Jr. Way S. Its most significant feature is its role as a major transportation and recreation corridor. The park provides direct access to the bicycle and pedestrian tunnel that runs through the Mount Baker Tunnel, connecting to the I-90 bridge trail and linking Seattle to Mercer Island and the Eastside.   

Beyond the courts, the park offers an ADA-compliant play area, adult exercise equipment, picnic tables, and the popular Blue Dog Pond off-leash area. It is also home to the "Urban Peace Circle," a sculpture by Gerard Tsutakawa dedicated to children who have been victims of gun violence, reinforcing the park's role as a space for community reflection.   

Beyond the Baseline in the Central District

The park sits at the crossroads of several historic Seattle neighborhoods, including the Central District and Judkins Park. This area is rich in cultural history, particularly as a center of Seattle's African American community. After a match, players can explore the nearby commercial areas along Rainier Avenue or in the Central District. The park itself connects directly to Judkins Park and Jimi Hendrix Park, creating an extended greenbelt for walking or biking.
