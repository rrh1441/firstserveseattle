The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility features two dedicated tennis courts, free from pickleball lines. The courts are unlit, so play is limited to daylight hours. They are part of a well-rounded neighborhood park that also includes two baseball fields and a children's play area. Note that the playfield was scheduled for renovation in the summer of 2023, which may have resulted in updated surfaces and amenities.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

Rogers Playground has a classic, friendly neighborhood park vibe. It's a popular spot for local families and residents, creating a relaxed and social atmosphere. With only two courts, they can be in demand during peak times like sunny weekends and after-work hours in the summer. However, it's generally a good spot for drop-in play, especially on weekdays. The surrounding trees and lawn create a pleasant and somewhat secluded feel, despite its proximity to major transportation corridors.

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Rogers

The courts at Rogers are straightforward, but the location presents a unique auditory challenge. The park is situated directly next to I-5, meaning there is a constant hum of traffic noise. Players who can successfully tune out this background noise and maintain their focus will have a significant advantage. The surrounding trees can help to mitigate wind, making for relatively consistent playing conditions.   

Location, Access, and Amenities

The playground is located on Eastlake Avenue E. Street parking is available on the surrounding streets. The park is well-equipped with amenities for a neighborhood facility, including restrooms, a drinking fountain, a sandbox, slides, swings, and climbing features for children. Its location makes it easily accessible for residents of Eastlake, Capitol Hill, and the University District.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Eastlake

Eastlake is a unique Seattle neighborhood characterized by its shoreline community of houseboats, apartments, and small businesses along the eastern edge of Lake Union. It has a quiet, residential feel but also features a handful of beloved local bars and restaurants. After a match, players can enjoy a walk along the lake, grab a drink at a local tavern, or head up the hill to the bustling Capitol Hill neighborhood.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Rogers Playground is a valued neighborhood asset, appreciated for its pleasant atmosphere and good range of facilities for families. For tennis players, the dedicated courts are a plus. The primary limitations are the lack of lights and the constant background noise from the adjacent I-5 freeway.
