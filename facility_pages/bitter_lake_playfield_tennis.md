The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The four concrete hard courts are situated along N 130th Street. A major advantage of this facility is that all four courts are lighted, extending playing hours into the evening during the spring, summer, and fall. The lights are typically operational from March through October. The courts have also been utilized for pickleball, with various layouts considered to maximize the number of courts, indicating that tennis players may encounter shared use with the pickleball community.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

With four lighted courts, Bitter Lake generally offers better court availability than smaller two-court facilities. The atmosphere is that of an active community park, with a steady flow of people using the adjacent playfield, community center, and walking paths. The presence of lights makes it a popular spot for after-work play during the longer days of the year. While reservations are available, the four-court setup often allows for drop-in play without excessive wait times, especially outside of peak evening hours.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Bitter Lake

The key to maximizing your experience at Bitter Lake is leveraging the lights. This is one of the more reliable North Seattle locations for an evening match. Plan your games for dusk to take advantage of cooler temperatures and potentially fewer crowds than at midday. Because the facility has four courts side-by-side, it can be a social and sometimes distracting environment. Players who excel at tuning out adjacent court noise and activity will have an advantage. Use the consistent hard-court surface to build rhythm in your groundstrokes.

Location, Access, and Amenities

The playfield is part of a large complex that includes the Bitter Lake Community Center, which houses restrooms and offers various programs. Ample parking is available in a dedicated lot, a significant convenience for players driving to the courts. The park also features a playground, a wading pool, baseball fields, and walking paths along the lake, providing numerous recreational options for players and their families.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Bitter Lake

Bitter Lake is a primarily residential neighborhood in northwest Seattle. While it lacks a central commercial district like some other Seattle neighborhoods, its proximity to Aurora Avenue N and Lake City Way NE means that a wide variety of restaurants, coffee shops, and stores are just a short drive away. The nearby Interurban Trail offers excellent opportunities for biking and running.
