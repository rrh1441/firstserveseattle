### The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility consists of two concrete hard courts equipped with lights, allowing for evening play. The courts are dedicated to tennis and are situated within the main park area, close to the beach and other amenities. The presence of lights is a major asset for a two-court facility in such a popular location.   

### The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

Madison Park has a bustling, energetic vibe, especially during the summer months when the beach and park are crowded with people. The atmosphere is social and can be loud, with the sounds of the beach and nearby activities providing a constant backdrop. With only two lighted courts in such a popular park, they are in very high demand. Securing a court for drop-in play can be challenging, and making a reservation well in advance is highly recommended.   

### Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Madison Park

The key to playing at Madison Park is managing the environment. The courts are close to the lake, so be prepared for potential breezes coming off the water. The biggest factor, however, is the high level of activity and noise from the surrounding park. Players who can block out distractions and stay focused will have a significant advantage. Use the lights to your advantage by scheduling matches in the evening when the beach crowds may have thinned out, but the park is still pleasantly active.

### Location, Access, and Amenities

The park is located at the eastern end of E Madison Street. Street parking is available but can be extremely difficult to find, particularly on sunny summer weekends. The park offers public restrooms, a swimming beach with lifeguards (in season), and a children's play area. The main commercial strip of Madison Park is directly adjacent to the park, offering numerous amenities.   

### The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Madison Park

Madison Park feels like a secluded, small-town hamlet tucked away on the shores of Lake Washington, despite being just a short drive from Capitol Hill and downtown. The neighborhood is known for its beautiful homes, lush greenery, and a cozy commercial district with upscale restaurants, cafes, and boutique shops. After a match, players can enjoy a meal with a view, browse the local shops, or take a walk along the waterfront.   

### From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

The Madison Park courts are prized for their beautiful location and the lively summer atmosphere. The availability of lights is a major plus. The primary challenge for players is the intense competition for court time due to the park's popularity and the limited number of courts. Parking is also a significant hurdle during peak season.
