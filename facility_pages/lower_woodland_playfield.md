The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The ten concrete hard courts are located in the eastern section of Woodland Park, just south of Green Lake. The courts are well-maintained and considered among the best public surfaces in the city. All ten courts are equipped with lights, making this the most reliable venue for evening and nighttime play in Seattle. To guarantee access for the public, courts 1, 2, 9, and 10 are permanently designated as non-reservable, walk-on courts.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

This is the place to be for Seattle tennis. The atmosphere is vibrant, social, and competitive. On any given day, you'll find a wide range of players, from beginners to high-level competitors. The courts are almost always busy, especially on evenings and weekends. A group of dedicated regulars, sometimes referred to as the "Greenlake mafia," are often found on the center courts, providing a great opportunity for high-quality pickup games. Despite the high traffic, the large number of courts and the designated walk-on courts mean that it's usually possible to get a game, though a wait is common during peak times.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Lower Woodland

Playing at Lower Woodland means being ready for a competitive environment. The biggest strategic advantage is knowing the court reservation system. If you need a guaranteed time, book one of the six reservable courts in advance. If you're dropping in, head straight for courts 1, 2, 9, or 10, as they are always first-come, first-served. On the court, be prepared for a fast-paced game; the well-maintained hard courts reward aggressive play. The social atmosphere can be a distraction, so the ability to focus and tune out the adjacent matches is key.   

Location, Access, and Amenities

The courts are located just off West Green Lake Way N. A parking lot is available, but it serves the entire popular playfield area (including a skatepark and multiple sports fields) and can fill up quickly. Public restrooms are located nearby. The facility's proximity to Green Lake means players have access to all the amenities of one of Seattle's premier parks.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Green Lake

The courts are situated between the Green Lake, Phinney Ridge, and Wallingford neighborhoods. This prime location offers an incredible variety of post-match options. Players can walk the Green Lake loop, visit the Woodland Park Zoo just up the hill, or explore the numerous cafes, restaurants, and bars in any of the three adjacent neighborhoods.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Lower Woodland is widely hailed as the best place for public tennis in Seattle. Players praise the number of courts, the quality of the surfaces, the lights, and the vibrant, competitive community. It's the go-to spot to find a good match. The only significant drawback is how busy it can get, leading to potential wait times for a court, even with ten available.
