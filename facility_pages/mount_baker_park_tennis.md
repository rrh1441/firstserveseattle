The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility consists of two concrete hard courts that are equipped with lights. The lights are seasonal, typically operational from March through October, allowing for evening play during the warmer, longer months. The courts are located in the upper section of the park, just north of the playground on Lake Park Dr S. They are also lined for pickleball, so tennis players should be prepared for shared use and extra lines on the court surface.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The upper park area where the courts are located is generally much quieter than the bustling beach area below. This provides a peaceful, focused atmosphere for tennis. With only two courts, they can be occupied during peak times, but they are often less crowded than larger facilities. The vibe is relaxed and recreational. The presence of lights makes it a valuable spot for local players looking for an evening game.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Mount Baker

The courts are nestled among the old trees of the park, which can provide some shelter from the wind but also create dappled light and shadows at certain times of day. Players who can adapt to changing light conditions will have an advantage. The proximity to Lake Washington means that humidity can be slightly higher, which can slow the ball down and lead to longer rallies. This is a great court for patient baseliners who can construct points.   

Location, Access, and Amenities

The courts are in the upper part of Mount Baker Park. A small parking lot is available near the courts, and street parking can be found along Lake Park Dr S. The main park amenities, including the bathhouse with restrooms and the swimming beach, are located down the hill on Lake Washington Boulevard. A recently renovated playground is situated at the south end of the upper park, near the courts.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Mount Baker

Mount Baker is a historic and affluent residential neighborhood in southeast Seattle, known for its stunning views of Lake Washington and the Cascade Mountains, and its beautiful homes. The neighborhood was planned by the Olmsted brothers and features winding boulevards and extensive parkland. While primarily residential, it has a small commercial area on 31st Avenue South and is in close proximity to the vibrant commercial districts of Columbia City and Leschi.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Mount Baker Park is a beloved local destination, especially its family-friendly swimming beach. The tennis courts are a valued amenity, particularly because they are lighted. The dual-lining for pickleball reflects the city-wide trend of adapting courts for multiple uses. The courts' location in the quieter upper park is seen as a plus for players seeking a more focused environment.
