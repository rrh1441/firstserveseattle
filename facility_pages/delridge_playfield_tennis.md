The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility has two concrete hard courts that are also lined for pickleball, reflecting the multi-sport nature of the park. Tennis players should expect the additional lines on the court surface and be prepared to share court time with the pickleball community. There are no lights for the tennis courts, so play is limited to daylight hours. While the larger athletic fields at the playfield are lighted for evening use, this does not extend to the tennis courts.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

Delridge Playfield is a bustling and active park, especially during warmer months and on weekends. The atmosphere is lively and diverse, with the sounds of the nearby skatepark and sports fields creating a constant backdrop of activity. This is a great spot for players who enjoy an energetic environment. With only two dual-use courts, wait times can be expected during peak hours. Organized pickleball open play is sometimes scheduled here, such as from 10:00 a.m. to Noon, which tennis players should be aware of.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Delridge

The key to success at Delridge is focus. The playfield is a hub of constant motion and sound, from the skatepark to the soccer fields. Players who can effectively block out external distractions and concentrate on their match will have a distinct mental advantage. The dual-lined courts require extra visual concentration to track the tennis boundaries. Use the energetic vibe of the park to fuel your own on-court intensity and footwork.
