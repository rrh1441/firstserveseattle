The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility features two concrete hard courts that are dedicated to tennis, offering a playing experience free from the distraction of other sport markings. The courts are unlit, limiting play to daylight hours. They are situated within a larger playfield that includes a running track and fields for football, soccer, and baseball.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

Montlake Playfield has a peaceful, family-friendly atmosphere that reflects the character of the surrounding neighborhood. The courts are well-used by local residents but are generally less crowded than major tennis hubs, making it a good option for finding an open court for drop-in play. The vibe is casual and recreational, with the adjacent community center providing a steady stream of activity.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Montlake

The courts are set in a beautiful, green environment, which can be both inspiring and distracting. The proximity to the Montlake Cut and Lake Washington means that gentle breezes can be a factor in play. The courts are surrounded by a running track, which can mean constant motion in your peripheral vision. Players who can settle into a calm, focused mindset that matches the park's serene atmosphere will play their best tennis here.

Location, Access, and Amenities

The playfield is located next to the Montlake Community Center, which houses restrooms and offers a variety of drop-in programs like badminton and pickleball. The park itself features a children's play area, adult fitness equipment, and sports fields. Street parking is available on the surrounding residential streets. The park's location provides easy access to the University of Washington campus just across the Montlake Bridge.   

The Neighborhood: Beyond the Baseline in Montlake

Montlake is a wealthy and picturesque residential neighborhood known for its early 20th-century Craftsman and Tudor-style homes. It has a very small but charming commercial corridor on 24th Avenue East with a few beloved local restaurants and shops. The neighborhood's defining features are its proximity to the water and the massive Washington Park Arboretum, which offers miles of beautiful walking trails.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

Montlake Playfield is a valued neighborhood park, appreciated for its beautiful setting and comprehensive facilities. The dedicated tennis courts are a key asset for local players. The primary limitation is the lack of lights, which restricts play, especially in the fall and winter months.
