## The West Seattle Overlook: Solstice Park

Your First Serve of Information

Perched on a hill in the Fauntleroy neighborhood, Solstice Park offers a tennis experience defined by its expansive views and unique astronomical features. Formerly known as Lincoln Park Annex, this facility combines a large, six-court tennis complex with a hilltop park designed to align with the setting sun on the solstices and equinoxes. A match here comes with a sense of elevation, both literally and figuratively, with sweeping vistas of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains serving as a spectacular backdrop.

The Courts: An In-Depth Look

Solstice Park is one of the larger public tennis facilities in West Seattle, boasting six courts divided into two sets of three. The courts are equipped with lights, allowing for play after sunset, a crucial feature for a park named after the sun's journey. The facility also includes a backboard for solo practice. The courts are located at the base of the park, directly adjacent to Fauntleroy Way SW, with a trail leading up the hill past a P-Patch community garden to the park's signature viewpoint.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

The atmosphere at Solstice Park is a blend of a dedicated sports facility and a tranquil neighborhood park. The six courts attract a steady stream of tennis players, creating an active and focused environment for the sport. However, the park's hilltop trails and astronomical features also draw walkers, stargazers, and community gardeners, adding a layer of quiet, contemplative energy.   

With six lighted courts, availability is generally better here than at smaller two-court facilities. However, the park is a focal point for the West Seattle tennis community and can be busy during prime evening and weekend hours. The park's operating hours, from 4 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., provide a generous window for play.   

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Solstice Park

The park's elevated, exposed location means that wind coming off Puget Sound can be a significant factor. Players who can adjust their game to handle gusty conditions will have an advantage. The lights are a major strategic asset, allowing for competitive matches long after sunset dims the unlit courts elsewhere in the city. The lights on the courts can sometimes interfere with the dark-sky viewing from the overlook above, but for players, they are a welcome feature.   

Location, Access, and Amenities

Solstice Park is located in the Fauntleroy neighborhood of West Seattle, directly across the street from the much larger Lincoln Park. Street parking is available on the surrounding streets, with a small lot of about 13 spaces on the south side of the park.   

The park's most notable feature is the earthwork and stone sundial at the top of the hill, which is designed to frame the setting sun on the summer and winter solstices. The park also contains a thriving P-Patch community garden and a network of trails connecting the courts to the viewpoint.   

Beyond the Baseline in Fauntleroy

Fauntleroy is a predominantly residential neighborhood with a mellow, tranquil vibe and stunning views of Puget Sound. The area is defined by its proximity to the water, the Fauntleroy ferry terminal providing access to Vashon Island, and the vast expanse of Lincoln Park. The commercial district is small, centered around a few beloved local spots, creating a quiet, community-focused atmosphere perfect for a post-match walk along the shore.   

From the Community: Player Reviews Summarized

The tennis courts at Solstice Park are highly rated by the community, earning a 5/5 average rating in one survey, praised for having six well-maintained, lighted courts. However, the park recently became a focal point in the city-wide tension between tennis and pickleball players. In 2023, Seattle Parks announced a plan to add pickleball lines to three of the six courts as part of a resurfacing project. The proposal drew strong feedback from the tennis community, who wished to keep the courts dedicated to their sport. In a surprising turn, SPR reversed its decision, canceling the Solstice Park striping and instead proposing a new, dedicated pickleball facility at nearby Lincoln Park—a plan that itself was later scrapped after further community debate. This sequence of events has left Solstice Park as a dedicated tennis site, but it stands as a clear example of the ongoing struggle to allocate limited public court space between two passionate and growing user groups.
