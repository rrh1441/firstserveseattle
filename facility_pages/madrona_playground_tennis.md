The Courts: An In-Depth Look

The facility features two concrete hard courts that are equipped with lights, allowing for play to extend into the evening. However, some sources indicate the courts are unlit, suggesting that the lights may be unreliable or seasonal, so players should be prepared for daytime-only play as a possibility. The courts are dedicated to tennis and are located within a multi-sport park.   

The Playing Experience: Atmosphere & Availability

Madrona Playground is a true neighborhood hub, with a friendly and family-oriented atmosphere. The courts are frequently used by students from the adjacent school, local families, and residents. With two lighted courts, the facility can accommodate a good number of players, but they can be busy after school and in the evenings. The vibe is generally casual and welcoming.

Strategic Corner: Gaining Your Edge at Madrona

The courts are situated in a relatively compact park, surrounded by residential homes and trees, which can help to block some of the wind. The key here is to be adaptable. If the lights are not operational, have a backup plan or adjust your schedule for daytime play. The proximity to the school and playground means there will be background noise; maintaining focus is important. The courts are straightforward, rewarding solid, fundamental tennis.   

Location, Access, and Amenities

The park is located at the intersection of 34th Ave and E Spring St. Street parking is available in the surrounding residential neighborhood. The park is well-equipped with amenities, including public restrooms, a children's play area, basketball courts, and soccer fields. A drinking fountain is also available on-site. A renovation of the play area is currently in the community input phase, which will further improve the park's facilities.
